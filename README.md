EulerPython
===========

Author: Gregory Yang

This repository holds my code for solving the problems hosted on Project Euler (http://projecteuler.net/) problems in Python.  All problems are solved using Python; as of the start date, I am using Project Euler to teach myself Python in an effort to expanding my programming capabilities. As a note, this is my first run-through of the problems hosted on the site.
